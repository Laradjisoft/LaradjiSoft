## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a professor of physics at the University of Memphis. My research group has been working a wide range of problems on soft matter and biological physics through computer simulations. We developed an extensive molecular dynamics codes for multiprocessing CPUs and GPUs. You are welcome to contact me if you are interested in collaboration.
